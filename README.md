To help my own poor memory.  

You can touch a map with drag, pinch and spam. Thanks to Unfolding map library, you can use the world map and change map providers. (including picures from satellite image and black-white map)

When `i` pushed, it enable the input mode which allow user to search the places by name and registor relation between two places.  

The more the location is stored, the bigger circle it gets.  
The more the relation is stored, the thicker line it gets.


## Data files
`/data` is a directory for storing data files. There are two data files in this program.

* `/data/location.csv` data file to store location point (GPS values)  
* `/data/relation.csv` data file to store relationship between points.  

## Vesion
Using Processing 2.2.1  
unfolding map cannot be used in Processing 3.x (on 1/Apr/2016)
